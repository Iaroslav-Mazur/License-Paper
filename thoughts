How to make the code more readable:
	- use readable names for both variables and functions
	- make the functions do a single thing only
	- split the code in more files/classes

Problems:
	- when a node mines a new block, it somehow becomes more likely to be the first to mine the next several blocks
	- when a new node appears while the others are intensively mining(or waiting?), it cannot catch up - desync happens
	- maximize_active_peers does not do its job!
