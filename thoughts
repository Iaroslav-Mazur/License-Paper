Ideas to reduce CPU load:
	- put the mining process to sleep after every hash check

How to make the code more readable:
	- place functions in the order in which they are called
	- use readable names for both variables and functions
	- make the functions do a single thing only
	- split the code in more files/classes

Problems:
	-when a node mines a new block, it somehow becomes more likely to be the first to mine the next several blocks
